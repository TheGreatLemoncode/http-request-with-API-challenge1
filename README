This idea came to me like a thunderbolt (i should maybe watch the movie).
"how can i connect to an account that is on a server ?"
I know right ? It is no different from magic. how can the mail and password
just turn into my 1000 hours play time on warframe ? So i thought and thought 
and came to the conclusion that is an async call to the server with the informations 
you gave as a POST request. The result is, if i'm not wrong, a sort of session key 
that allow the game and the server to communicate between them. So this project is to 
simulate a connection to a server using async methods and sort of keeping the connection 
alive. First project and already tired.
